\section{Overview}

In machine learning literature, multi-label classification is a variant of the classification problem in which each example has several labels. In general, the task of multi-label learning is to find a model that can maps inputs \textbf{x} to binary vector \textbf{y}. While it is different with multi-class classfication in terms of the later one scalars outputs in classification problem.
